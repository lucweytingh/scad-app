0,"Skin-like texture with prominent branching veins, some thin and thread-like, others thick and raised, evenly distributed over a slightly rough surface"
1,"Vague texture with irregularly shaped speckles of varying sizes, concentrated in clusters and scattered sparsely in other areas, on a smooth background"
2,"Smooth texture with faint, thin veins radiating out symmetrically from a central point, gradually fading at the edges"
3,"Translucent texture with bold, crisscrossing veins in a grid-like pattern, slightly raised and highlighted against a soft, glossy base"
4,"Layered texture with thin, curled sheets overlapping at uneven angles, resembling peeling skin with a dry and flaky appearance"
5,"Speckled texture with dense, sharp-edged dots in a mix of large, medium, and small sizes, randomly distributed on a matte background"
6,"Smooth texture with shallow, flowing ripples arranged in parallel lines, creating a water-like effect under dim light"
7,"Glossy texture with ripples forming concentric circles, reflecting light like liquid metal, with a consistent sheen"
8,"Layered texture with tightly packed, overlapping sheets, each slightly tilted and textured with faint horizontal striations"
9,"Smooth texture with soft, wavy ripples running horizontally, appearing almost fluid-like under subtle illumination"
10,"Skin-like texture with thick, branching veins that spread symmetrically from multiple central points, rising slightly above the surface"
11,"Speckled texture with distinct patches of small dots clustered in circular formations, with a gradient of density fading outwards"
12,"Layered texture with soft, overlapping folds arranged in a radial pattern, resembling the symmetry of a blooming flower"
13,"Vague texture with a cloudy, gradient background interspersed with sharply defined speckles in random placements"
14,"Smooth texture with wide, shallow ripples arranged concentrically, with consistent spacing and a uniform matte finish"
15,"Net-like texture with faint, irregular veins that intersect in a semi-symmetrical web pattern, evenly spaced across the surface"
16,"Layered texture with paper-thin sheets curled at the edges, stacked irregularly but following a consistent direction"
17,"Speckled texture with irregularly shaped, sharp-edged dots scattered unevenly, with some areas densely packed and others sparse"
18,"Smooth texture with subtle, flowing lines arranged diagonally, creating a dynamic, wave-like motion"
19,"Layered texture with tightly packed, symmetrical scales or petals arranged in a radial formation, with a slightly glossy finish"
20,"Skin-like texture with fine, raised lines that interweave into an organic lattice, resembling the growth patterns of roots"
